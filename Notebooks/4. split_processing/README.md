Due to the size of the files which for some reason took me a really long time to in totality I have decided to split the files and merge them later on. Due to the way i have split and merged the rows would still retain its integrity and would not cause rows to mix up.
Initially there were 5 files with the other 3 being batch processing of the topic matrix. The topic matrix would contain the probability scores of each email for all the 7 topics. 


These are the 2 files:

| file name | purpose |
|---|---|
|4a. Split Processing.ipynb| split file to apply LDA model|
|4b. Topic_matrix - Combined.ipynb| process each file in parts and create a topic matrix|
