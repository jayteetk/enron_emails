### Foreword
This little repo was created for a project done during my course with General Assembly and may see further future enhancements, time permitting. Overall, this project is meant to be a proof of concept, utilizing NLP, Network analysis, and simple dashboarding to illustrate insights that can be achieved with a simplistic layer of machine learning on what is otherwise an data retrevial process. 

### Problem Statement
Business owners may not necessarily be privy to what is going on the ground due to higher level priorities or due to the pace in which their businesses move. Today, knowledge does not suffice and the flexibility to pivot to other issues while valued may cause confusion both from a resource allocation perspective and issue diagnosis.  

### Objective
Using NLP techniques such as Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) this project would 
    1) Identify key topics
    2) Attribute topics to messages exchanged in the corpus
Using Network Graphs
    1) Identify Degree of each User
    2) Identify networks that exist using Louvain algorthim.
Once the above has been identified and attributed:
    1) Examine topic use over time, by user/email address 
    2) Identify any topical significance of each employee position type.
